Structs are complex data types, meaning that they are made up of multiple values.
You then create an instance of the struct and fill in its values,
then you can pass it around as a single value in your code.
For example, we could define a Person struct type that contains three properties name , age and country
the structure definition starts with the keyword
```swift
struct{}
```
